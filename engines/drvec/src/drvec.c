 *

 *  is white noise -- then the error of the VEC representation is
 *
 *      eps_t = [ beta' eta_t + Theta(B) a_t ;  eta_t ].
 *
 *  Regrouping on A_t = [a_t + beta' eta_t ; eta_t], which is an invertible
 *  transformation of the noise, that is eps_t = A_t - Theta1 A_{t-1} with
 *
 *      Theta = [ Theta11   Theta11 B2' ]        (B2 = -beta; ESTUDIO_BVECM 2.1)
 *              [    0           0      ]
 *
 *  that is: THE LAST s ROWS ARE ZERO and the upper-right block is NOT free, it
 *  is determined by the left one and by B2.  With M = 2 and r = 1 that leaves
 *  ONE moving-average parameter where the free model carries FOUR.
 *
 *  And this is not a modelling preference, it is measured.  Simulating the
 *  paper's own WARMA DGP (theta = 0.5, beta = 0.5, n = 1000) and fitting with a
 *  free Theta, drvec returns entries of 3.26, 7.50 or -2.44 where the truth is

 *  Ybar = [nabla Y2 ; W], which are the ones Definition 3 of the BVECM uses and

 *               [ 0   Phi_k ]                 [ 0  Th_k   ]

 *  -- and the differenced block carries no moving averages.  And B2 enters ONLY
 *  THROUGH THE DATA, when W is formed by subtraction, like the input of a
 *  transfer function; it touches no parameter.  That is what the legacy shootx
 *  does and the measured reason why its surface is better conditioned
 *  (docs/ESTUDIO_BVECM_vs_DRVEC.md 3.1).

 *  (p-1) M x r blocks, q r x r blocks, Sigma, and B2 in the tail -- so as not
 *  to touch the bootstrap, the profiling or B2's tail, all of which depend on
 *  that layout.  What changes is that they are read as coefficients of W_{t-k}

/*  subtract_interventions — removes from the data the deterministic component
 *  each series declares in its .pre.
 *
 *  WHY IT IS NEEDED.  fue's cast admits interventions -- omega(B)/delta(B) on
 *  an impulse, step, ramp... -- and the univariate models of the ladder use
 *  them.  Estimating a VEC afterwards that ignores them is estimating a
 *  different model: in the exercise that motivated this, a series with a
 *  five-year response impulse over a sample of 76 gave a cointegrating vector
 *  with no economic sense (positive), and that omission was the cause.
 *
 *  HOW.  build_det_component comes with the vendored reader and computes
 *  nu(B) = omega(B)/delta(B) applied to the regressor, with the Box-Jenkins
 *  sign convention (omega_0 adds, the rest subtract) and the rational case
 *  included.  It is handed the .pre's model but THE DATES OF THIS SAMPLE,
 *  because a deterministic term is a function of time: align them by index
 *  instead of by date and the intervention lands in the wrong year.
 *
 *  LIMIT, declared: the omegas stay FIXED at whatever fue estimated
 *  separately; they are not re-estimated jointly.  drtran does carry them in
 *  its parameter vector (BRIDGE_DESIGN.md), and that is the natural next step.
 *  Meanwhile this is "the univariate model's interventions, applied", which is
 *  a good deal better than "no interventions" and worse than estimating them. */

/*  residual_diagnostics — the multivariate diagnosis of the residuals.
 *
 *  WHY IT IS HERE.  drvec did NO diagnosis at all: main.h declares hosking_test
 *  and multivariate_diagnostics inherited from drvarma's header, but those
 *  routines do not exist in this project and the .out said nothing about the
 *  residuals.  An estimator that does not show its residuals cannot be used to
 *  identify, and in the application that motivated this the question is
 *  precisely one of identification: with the univariate ARMA inherited from
 *  clean ACF/PACF work, all that is left to decide is whether there are CROSS
 *  EFFECTS and of what order.  That is not answered by looking at the
 *  likelihood; it is answered by looking at the CROSS correlations of the
 *  residuals, lag by lag.
 *
 *  WHAT IT PRINTS, IN TWO PARTS
 *
 *   1. THE SUITE'S DIAGNOSIS, as it comes: multivariate_diagnostics from
 *      drtran -- Hosking's portmanteau and multivariate Jarque-Bera -- copied
 *      unchanged into src/diagnose_mv.c.  That is deliberate: the same residual
 *      has to read the same in drvarma, in drtran and here.  The first version
 *      of this was a portmanteau written by hand in this file, and it was badly
 *      framed even though it was correct: it forced a comparison of apples with
 *      oranges.
 *
 *   2. WHAT DRVEC ADDS, fitted to its own reality: the cross-correlation matrix
 *      R(k) for k = 0..K, with whatever crosses the +-2/sqrt(n) band marked.
 *      The DIAGONAL of R(k) is each equation's own ACF (own dynamics badly
 *      captured); the OFF-DIAGONAL ones are the cross effect the model has not
 *      captured, and their k is THEIR ORDER.  That is what an aggregate
 *      portmanteau cannot say, and it is exactly the question that is left when
 *      the univariate ARMA arrives already identified from clean ACF/PACF work:
 *      whether there are cross effects and of what order.
 *
 *  R(k)[i][j] correlates a_i(t) with a_j(t-k), so a significant (i,j) element
 *  with k >= 1 says that equation i responds to the PAST innovation of j: it is
 *  a lagged cross effect of order k.  The upper and lower triangles are NOT the
 *  same thing, and that is where the direction is.                           */

 *  THE PROBLEM.  est() computes the covariance by inverting the Hessian that
 *  BFGS ACCUMULATES along the trajectory (raxopt leaves it in mtmp).  That is
 *  good for steering the search but is NOT the curvature at the optimum: it
 *  depends on the path taken and degrades precisely in the flattest directions,
 *  which are the ones with the largest standard errors.  This is not a
 *  suspicion -- drtran diagnosed and fixed it (BRIDGE_DESIGN.md 8c) -- and here
 *  the extreme symptom showed up: with -multistart, since the final est does
 *  not iterate, ALL the standard errors came out identical.
 *
 *  THE ALTERNATIVE WAS NOTED IN THE ENGINE ITSELF, commented out at
 *  drvmlest.c:104-107:  fdhess + choldcp.  That is what is used, without
 *  touching the engine: fdhess is a public symbol of qnewtopt.c and the
 *  objective is our own.
 *
 *  cov = 2 * f * H^-1 / n, the same formula est uses (drvmlest.c:111-119); all

 *  "finite sample performance of the test is affected by the MA terms".
 *
 *  HOW.  Parametric bootstrap: N samples are simulated UNDER H0 with the
 *  parameters estimated at rank r, the LR(r -> r+1) statistic is recomputed on
 *  each, and the empirical percentiles are the critical values.  It is what
 *  BVECM 6.3-6.5 prescribes.
 *
 *  THE SIMULATION EXPLOITS THE TRANSFORMATION, instead of reimplementing a VEC:
 *  the fitted model IS a stationary VARMA on Ybar, so it is simulated there --
 *  with elf's convention, (w-mu) = SUM phi (w-mu) + a - SUM theta a -- and the
 *  transformation is INVERTED to get back to levels:
 *
 *      nabla Y2 = Ybar[1..s]         -> Y2 by cumulating from the real level
 *      Y1       = W - B2' Y2          with W = Ybar[s+1..M]
 *
 *  That leaves a sample in the same format as the .inp, so the re-estimations
 *  are EXACTLY those of the normal route, with no parallel code that could
 *  drift from the one being calibrated.
 *
 *  The generator is deterministic with a fixed seed: a critical value that
 *  cannot be reproduced is no use for deciding anything.                     */

/*  Convergence note — WHY it stopped, not just WHETHER it stopped.
 *
 *  In multivariate VARMA the reason for stopping is a first-order diagnostic:
 *  ill-conditioned likelihoods, near non-identification and common factors all
 *  show up as termination on steptol rather than on the gradient.  The suite
 *  had already established this -- drvarma fixed it in its
 *  report._convergence_block and drtran exposes it as Fit.convergence_note --
 *  and drvec printed the criterion without saying what it means.
 *
 *  TWO THINGS THIS NOTE FIXES, both inherited:
 *
 *   - termcode 2 (steptol) was announced as a flat "OPTIMIZER CONVERGED".  It
 *     is, in the program's sense, but it is the typical symptom of an
 *     ill-conditioned likelihood and the standard errors are not to be trusted.
 *   - "ESTIMATION SUCCESSFUL (ifault=0)" reads as convergence and IS NOT:
 *     ifault is MODEL adequacy, not the optimiser's (drvarma documents this
 *     explicitly).  A fit that stopped far from an optimum can perfectly well
 *     report ifault = 0.
 *
 *  HOW THE TERMCODE IS OBTAINED.  est() does not return it, and report() lives
 *  in qnewtopt.c, which is ENGINE and is not touched -- not by one line, not
 *  even to expose an observable.  So it is read back from the text report()
 *  already wrote into the .out itself.  That is fragile with respect to that
 *  string and nothing else, and the alternative was editing published, refereed
 *  code.
 *
 *  Returns the termcode 1..5, or 0 if it could not be determined.            */

/*  P5 — THE FORECAST, IN LEVELS, WITH ITS BANDS                              */
/*****************************************************************************/
/*  WHY IT EXISTS.  Until 2026-08-20 drvec could not forecast: none of its
 *  options did it, there was no out-of-sample evaluation, and the register had
 *  seventeen hundred lines about estimation and no measurement of the one thing
 *  that decides whether a multivariate model is worth its parameters -- whether
 *  it improves on a univariate forecast.  See docs/PLAN_PRODUCCION.md P5.
 *
 *  HOW.  The fitted model IS a stationary VARMA on Ybar = (nabla Y2 ; W), so
 *  the forecast is made there with elf's recursion and the transformation is
 *  INVERTED, exactly as simulate_h0 does for the bootstrap.  There is no
 *  parallel code: it is the same inversion.
 *
 *      nabla Y2_{n+h} = Ybar_{n+h}[1..s]  ->  Y2 by cumulating from Y2_n
 *      W_{n+h}        = Ybar_{n+h}[s+1..M]
 *      Y1_{n+h}       = W_{n+h} - B2' Y2_{n+h}
 *
 *  THE VARIANCE, AND THE LESSON OF BUG-10.  In the sibling program the level
 *  was integrated correctly in the MEAN and incorrectly in the VARIANCE,
 *  because each reached the level by its own route: the mean asked its
 *  authoritative source for the operator and the variance rebuilt one of its
 *  own from (d, D, s).  The defect is invisible in the point forecast and comes
 *  out whole in the bands -- a factor of 19 in variance in the measured case --
 *  and the bias always runs the dangerous way: omitting non-stationary factors
 *  can only NARROW the band.
 *
 *  Here the integration is a single one (nabla on the Y2 block) and the W block
 *  is not integrated, but the trap is the same: Y1 = W - B2'Y2 INHERITS the
 *  cumulated error of Y2, and computing its band from W's alone leaves it
 *  systematically narrow.  So the map from innovations to level error is
 *  written ONCE, in level_error_map(), and the band comes from there.  With
 *  Psi_m the MA(inf) weights of the transformed system and C_m = sum_{k<=m}
 *  Psi_k:
 *
 *      G_m = [           rows 1..s of C_m             ]
 *            [ rows s+1..M of Psi_m - B2' (rows 1..s of C_m) ]
 *
 *      Var(h) = sum_{m=0}^{h-1} G_m Sigma* G_m',    Sigma* = sigma2 * qq
 *
 *  At h = 1, C_0 = Psi_0 = I and G_0 = [I_s 0 ; -B2' I_r], so the one-step band
 *  is the innovation covariance read in levels.  The suite checks that, and
 *  also checks the identity that really ties the calculation down: the one-step
 *  forecast from origin n-1 reproduces the datum minus the stored residual.   */

 *
 *  PROVENANCE, read before copying.  It is drvarma's function, which lives in

 *  lineage as elfvarma.c.  The first version of this section rewrote it, which
 *  is a third copy of a shared function and exactly the drift
 *  docs/PLAN_PRODUCCION.md P3 exists to prevent.  It was replaced by the
 *  suite's, character for character, on 2026-08-20.  If it is fixed there, it
 *  has to be fixed here.
 *
 *  Psi_0 = I;  Psi_l = sum_{i<=min(l,p)} Phi_i Psi_{l-i} - Theta_l (l <= q).
 *  Here it is applied to the TRANSFORMED VARMA on Ybar, which is where the
 *  model is stationary; the step to levels is another matter and is not

 *  parameters FIXED, and advance the origin one datum at a time over E..n-H,
 *  comparing each forecast with what actually happened.  The sibling program's

 *  an honest measurement but would cost n-E-H optimisations; and above all it
 *  would mix two things -- what the model predicts and what the re-estimation
 *  learns -- that are better kept apart.  What matters is that the parameters
 *  have NOT seen the datum they are scored against, and the window gives that.
 *
 *  THE RESIDUALS.  The recursion needs the shocks up to the origin, and at
 *  origins later than E they do not exist yet.  They are obtained in ONE pass:
 *  Ybar is rebuilt over the whole sample with the parameters from 1..E and elf

    /*  ---- LONG-RUN GAIN AND MEAN LAG ---------------------------------- *
     *
     *  drvarma accumulates the response of the STATIONARY system and calls the
     *  total the long-run gain (diagnose.c:1626).  Here the response is already
     *  in levels, so accumulating it again would diverge: G_k does not go to
     *  zero, it converges to the PERMANENT effect.  The two programs compute
     *  the same object all the same, and it is worth seeing why: drvec's level
     *  response is the accumulation of drvarma's, so drvec's INCREMENTS
     *  delta_k = G_k - G_{k-1} are what drvarma calls the response.  The gain
     *  and the mean lag are then drvarma's formulas applied to delta_k, and
     *
     *      gain     = sum_k delta_k = lim_k G_k        the permanent effect
     *      mean lag = sum_k k delta_k / sum_k delta_k  how long it takes
     *
     *  THE CERTIFICATE, and it is sharp: beta'Y_t is stationary, so a permanent
     *  shock cannot move it.  Therefore beta' C(1) = 0 EXACTLY, and the worst
     *  element of beta' gain is reported.  It exercises the whole chain at once
     *  -- the Psi weights, the level map, the orthogonalisation and the
     *  accumulation -- and it cannot be satisfied by accident.
     *
     *  The horizon for the limit is its own, and much longer than the printed
     *  one: a gain read off a table that stops at 20 is not a limit.          */

     *  data want that entry (-matri beats -marow by LR >= 5.96 in 37 of 40),
     *  and the free class forecast better in 8 of 9 cases (HOMOLOGATION 4t).

     *  test's theory assumes.  -marow, -matri, -mawarma and -warma remain,

     *  freedom wrong, and above all leaves no record.
     *
     *  WHAT EACH RUNG IS.  All with r = 0, i.e. with no VEC matrix yet: what is
     *  added is correlation structure, not cointegration.
     *
